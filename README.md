# Tinder-Like-Action-Bar
This repository will help you create Tinder like actionbar, which has the navigation drawer icon and the page tab in the same view.

This was created using TabBarView (https://github.com/Mirkoddd/TabBarView)

It can save the extra space of unused actionbar, I personally really like it. Check out this app I created using this library {https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pickup.pickrup}
